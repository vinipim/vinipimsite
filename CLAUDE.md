# Fix Progress - Railway Deployment Issue

## Issues Found & Fixed

1. ✅ **serveStatic() missing distPath parameter** - FIXED in server/\_core/index.ts:94
   - Changed: `serveStatic(app)` → `serveStatic(app, distPublicPath)`
   - Path: `path.join(__dirname, "public")`

2. ✅ **railway.toml startCommand** - FIXED
   - Changed: `pnpm start` → `node dist/index.js`
   - Better error handling for production

## Current Status

- Vite build config: ✅ OK (outputs to dist/public)
- Express static serving: ✅ FIXED (now has correct path)
- Railway config: ✅ FIXED (using direct node command)
- Database connection: ✅ OK (proper retry logic in server/db.ts)
- Environment variables: ✅ OK (server/\_core/env.ts loads correctly)

## Remaining Tasks

1. Build locally and test
2. Verify dist/public folder gets created
3. Start dev server to confirm

## Run Commands

```bash
cd c:\Users\vinil\vinipimsite\vinipimsite
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

Then commit and push to Railway.
