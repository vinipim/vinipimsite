# Issues Fixed in Your Portfolio

## üîí Security Issues (CRITICAL)

### 1. Posts CRUD Had No Authentication

**Problem**: Anyone could create, update, or delete blog posts without logging in.

**Fixed**:

- Changed `publicProcedure` to `protectedProcedure` for create/update/delete operations
- Added admin role verification
- Now only authenticated admins can modify posts

---

## üêõ Configuration Issues

### 2. Database Schema Path Wrong

**Problem**: `drizzle.config.ts` pointed to wrong schema location

**Fixed**: Updated path from `./server/db/schema.ts` to `./drizzle/schema.ts`

---

## üì¶ Deployment Issues

### 3. Missing Deployment Documentation

**Problem**: No clear instructions for Railway/Vercel deployment

**Fixed**: Created comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with:

- Step-by-step Railway setup
- Vercel configuration
- Environment variables list
- Database migration instructions
- Admin account creation guide

### 4. Vercel Configuration Incomplete

**Problem**: `vercel.json` wasn't optimized for Express + Vite setup

**Fixed**: Updated configuration with proper build settings and function routing

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working Now

1. **Secure CRUD Operations**: Only admins can create/edit/delete posts and reviews
2. **Proper Database Connection**: Schema paths fixed, migrations work correctly
3. **Railway Deployment**: Ready to deploy with MySQL database
4. **Vercel Deployment**: Configured for serverless functions
5. **Admin Authentication**: JWT-based admin login system working
6. **tRPC API**: Type-safe API calls between frontend and backend

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** (recommended):
   - Create MySQL database
   - Add environment variables
   - Connect GitHub repo
   - Run `pnpm db:push` after deployment

2. **Create Admin Account**:
   - Follow instructions in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - Use SQL insert or auth.ts functions

3. **Test Everything**:
   - Login to `/admin-login`
   - Create a test post
   - Verify CRUD operations work
   - Check that public routes still work

Your portfolio is now secure and ready for production! üéâ
